⚙️ How It Works

The user interacts with elements on the webpage.

Event listeners attached to buttons, input boxes, or the entire document capture:

Event type

Time of event

Target element

Additional metadata (like key pressed, mouse coordinates)

Captured event data is appended to a list for the user to review.
